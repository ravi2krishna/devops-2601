============

    -> What Is DevOps ?

        -> DevOps is a set of "PRACTICES" that works to "AUTOMATE" and "INTEGRATE" 
        the processes between Software Development (Dev) and IT Operations(Ops) teams.

    -> Development Team

        -> To "Build Applications" We need Roles Like 

                -> Software Architect 
                -> System Engineer
                -> Software Developers 
                -> Software Testers 
                -> etc 

    -> Operations Team

        -> To "Build Infrastructure" & Maintain Applications, We need Roles Like 

                -> System Admin 
                -> Network Admin 
                -> Cloud Admin 
                -> Security Admin 
                -> etc 

    -> DevOps Engineer

        -> DevOps Engineers will implement a set of "PRACTICES" using "TOOLS" so that 
        organizations can build, test, and deploy [ DELIVERY LINE ] software 
        faster and more reliably.

    
    -> DevOps PRACTICES     ==>     "TOOLS" 

        -> Version Control Systems (VCS) ==> Git

            -> For Tracking Code 

            -> Happens Inside Developer Laptop - Local To Individual Developer

        -> Source Code Management (SCM) ==> GitHub 

            -> Store Multiple Versions Of Code 

            -> Happens Inside Organization - Central to All Developer

        -> Containerization ==> Docker 

            -> To Get Acceleration (FASTER) 

        -> Orchestration ==> Kubernetes  

            -> To Get Reliability 
            
            -> Helps Run Applications Without Downtime (Run 24 X 7) - Production Environments 

        -> Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI-CD) ==> GitHub Actions 

            -> To Get Automation In Repetitive Tasks   

    -> DevOps Prerequisites 

        -> Application - Project

            -> SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle 

                -> Requirement -> Design -> Code -> "Build" -> Test -> Release -> "Deploy" 

        -> Servers (AWS & AZURE) - Charges (4 INR Per Hour) 

        -> Command Line Interface - CLI (Linux Commands)

    -> As a DevOps Engineer You are responsible for     

        -> Implement Automation

        -> Implement Acceleration (Fastness)

        -> Implement Reliability (Application Should Always Run)

    
    -> When we start building/developing a project 

        -> SDLC 

            -> The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process followed by 
            software development teams to design, develop and test high-quality software. 

            -> The SDLC consists of multiple stages such as 

                -> Requirement -> Design -> Code -> "Build" -> Test -> Release -> "Deploy" 

                -> NOTE: From DevOps Context 

                    -> Code -> "Build" -> Test -> "Deploy" 

                    -> "Build" & "Deploy" Applications On Servers 

        -> Requirement

            -> Build LMS (Learning Management System): Manage Courses 

                -> Three Tier App Architecture

                    -> One thing the most visited websites have in common is that they are dynamic websites.
                    Their development typically involves server-side coding, client-side coding and 
                    database technology.

            -> Most Popular Applications
                
                -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_languages_used_in_most_popular_websites

        -> Code 

            -> Developers will use "Git" to track code and eventually "Push" Code to "GitHub" 

        

9th Jan 2026
============

    -> LMS Project 

    -> "DEVELOPMENT" team

        -> DEVELOPMENT Team mainly builds Applications 

        -> DEVELOPMENT Means Coding 

    -> Version Control Systems (VCS)

        ->  Version control / Revision control / Source control
            is a process that helps to "keep track of changes" made to 
            files (computer programs, web site files, documents etc)

        -> https://www.sirhow.com/uploads/2023/07/check-gpay-transaction-history-step-4.jpg

        -> Advantage Of VCS is Revert Changes To Previous Working Versions, 
            if there are issues in new version

            -> TransactionIDs == Commit IDs 

    -> To Implement Version Control System we need "Git" Software 

        -> Git helps in tracking code / changes in your code 

        -> Git tracks code in your laptop 

        -> Git will generate commit id for every change we make (like every transaction me make in UPI)


    -> All the transactions made will be stored in Server, similarly we store all our
    commit id's in Source Code Management(SCM) like a Server 

        -> NOTE: Mobile Phone -> GooglePay -> Bank Server(TransactionIDs)

        -> NOTE: Laptop -> Git -> GitHub(Commit IDs )

    -> GitHub - Server Side Software  - Organizations

            -> GitHub provides a platform to store code and it's versions 

            -> GitHub Stores All Versions Of Code in centralized location (github.com)    

    -> NOTE: Example of Real World Application

        -> https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ - APP

        -> https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus - CODE

        -> https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/graphs/contributors - HISTORY 

        -> https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commits/master/ - Commits 

    -> Repository 

        -> A repository contains all of your "project's files" and each file's revision history. 
        Developers can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

            -> https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus

            -> https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/tags


    -> JIRA (Proprietary)

        -> Jira is a proprietary product developed by Atlassian that allows 
        bug tracking, issue tracking and agile project management. 

        -> https://images.ctfassets.net/xjcz23wx147q/2vuHCsAF3tUpzYykEb9GAX/11fb10694a339636aceb9f531f11e49f/Kanban-updated.png

    -> GitHub Projects & Issues (FREE)

            -> GitHub Projects are a feature within GitHub designed for planning and tracking work

            -> GitHub Issues is a built-in, lightweight issue-tracking system in every repository 
                used for planning, discussing, and tracking work like 
                bug reports, new features, and tasks.

12th Jan 2026
==============

    -> Implement(Start Coding) Issue / Feature Assigned to him 

    -> Developers Will Update Code To GitHub Repository

    -> Currently the Application is on GitHub 

    -> Can customers / clients access the Application from Github ?

        -> NO 

    -> We need Servers To Host / To Deploy Applications so that 
    customers / clients access the Application

    -> Operations Related Work
    
    -> Servers 

        -> A Server is a "computer system" that provides data or services 
            to others computers, known as "clients" over a network.

        -> Laptop can be used by one person at a time 
        
        -> Server can be used by multiple persons(clients) at a time 

    -> Physical Server 

        -> Physical Server Consists Of "Hardware" + "Operating System" (Linux OS - Ubuntu)

        -> CPU(Processor) + RAM + HDD + N/W Card
    
    -> Server Softwares 

        -> Web Server : Hosts and Serves Web Pages / Web Applications Over Internet 

            -> Examples : Apache Web Server, Nginx Web Server, IIS Server etc 

        -> Database Server : Hosts Application Data & Transactions

            -> Examples : MySQL Server, Postgres Server, MS SQL Server etc 

        -> Email Server : Software that sends, receives, and stores emails.

            -> Examples : Postfix Server, SendMail, Send grid etc 


    -> Where To get servers from ?

        -> Purchase Server 

            -> Purchasing Servers is QUITE COSTLY and from learning perspective we cannot
                afford a server 

            -> Rather than Purchasing Server, we want to "RENT SERVERS" 
        
        -> As per example discussed 

            -> Buying Server == Buying Bike 

            -> Renting Server == Renting Bike 

            -> Renting Bike : Pay for how many kilometers you traveled 

            -> Renting Server : Pay for how much you use i.e "PAY AS YOU GO" price model

                -> 1 Server for 1 hour 
                -> 1 Server for 5 hour 
                -> 1 Server for 5 days 

            -> Where can i rent bike ?

                -> Ola, Uber, Rapido etc 

            -> Where can i rent server ?

                -> AWS, AZURE, GCP, OCI etc

    -> Cloud Computing 

        -> Cloud computing is the "on-demand" delivery of "IT resources" 
        like servers, storage, and software over the "internet" 
        on a "pay-as-you-go" basis.

    -> In our course will implement servers on both "AWS" & "AZURE"

        -> AWS Cloud - FREE TRAIL - 6 Months - $200

        -> AZURE Cloud - FREE TRAIL - 1 Month - $200

    
    -> AWS Account Setup - LABS 
        
        Visit - https://aws.amazon.com/free

    -> AZURE Account Setup - LABS
        
        Visit - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/

    -> Following Details Required - Cloud Setup

        Unique Email ID
        Unique Mobile Number
        Unique PAN CARD
        Unique Debit / Credit Card

19th Jan 2026
==============

    -> AWS Server Setup 

        -> Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2) is a part of Amazon's cloud-computing platform, 
        Amazon Web Services, that "allows users to rent virtual computers(servers)" 
        on which to run their "own computer applications".

        -> Server                   ==> AWS EC2 Instance 
        -> Server Name              ==> Instance Name 
        -> Operating System         ==> AMI - Amazon Machine Image (Linux Ubuntu 22.04)
        -> CPU + RAM                ==> Instance Types(t2.micro, t2.medium etc)           
        -> Login / Authentication   ==> Key Pairs (Public Key & Private Key)
        -> Network                  ==> VPC(Virtual Private Cloud)
        -> Firewall                 ==> Security Group (Rules: Protocol, Port, Source)
        -> Storage (Hard Disk)      ==> EBS Volume (Elastic Block Storage) is 8 GB 

        -> Login To AWS 

            -> https://aws.amazon.com/console/ 


    -> Firewall 
    
        -> A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls 
            incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules (protocols) 

        -> SSH Protocol (Secure Shell)

            -> Is a network protocol used for secure remote access to 
                computers over an unsecured network.

            -> SSH allows users to log in, run commands and transfer files securely.

            -> SSH typically runs on TCP port 22

    -> How To Connect With Server ?

        -> SSH Client Softwares 

            -> A software program which uses SSH to connect with remote linux server 

            -> From Online 
                
                -> https://ssheasy.com/

            -> From Laptop / System Use any one of the below Software 

                -> GitBash (recommended) it provides ssh & also git 
                -> Terminal 
                -> Putty 
                -> etc 

            -> Open GitBash / Terminal etc 

                -> Navigate to location where private key is present i.e pem file 
                    -> cd downloads 
                -> Set pem file permissions to READ only 
                    -> chmod 400 key 
                -> Use below ssh command to connect with server 
                    -> ssh -i identity_file/private_key username@public-ip-address 

    
    -> NOTE: We are using Linux Servers, which has only CLI (Command Line Interface)

    -> CLI - Command Line Interface

        -> CLI is a powerful tool for interacting with servers 
            through "text based commands" 

        -> CLI is very helpful in Automating Repetitive Tasks 

    
    -> Requirement From Customer 

        -> Create 100 Text files 
        -> Assume you don't have any CLI knowledge 
        -> Then we are left with GUI - Graphical User Interface 
            -> 1 text file creation - 3 seconds 
            -> 100 text file creation - 300 seconds (5 mins)
            -> 100000 text file creation - 300000 seconds (5000 mins) 

    -> Resolving Requirement From Customer Using CLI 

        -> touch file-{1..100}.txt

    -> Hardware & System Software(OS) Commands 

        -> CPU / Processor Info 

            -> cat /proc/cpuinfo 
        
        -> RAM Info 

            -> free -m 

        -> Disk Info 

            -> df -h 

        -> Network  Info 

            -> ip address 

    -> System Software (OS)

        -> uname 
        -> cat /etc/os-release 

    -> Check Running Processes 

        -> ps -ef 
        -> htop (to quit click q on keyboard)

    -> Once Application is Developed 

    -> How Customers Will Access Application ?

        -> Customers Will Access Application Via Servers 

    
    -> To Host / Deploy Applications, Follow Below Approach 

        -> Create Server 

        -> Install Appropriate Softwares On Servers 

        -> Host / Deploy Application On Server 

        NOTE: Above Activities are Operations Oriented 

    -> Web Server 

        -> A web server is computer software [ Nginx HTTP Server ] 
        and underlying hardware [ AWS Instance / AZURE VM ] 
        that accepts requests via HTTP (port 80) 
        to distribute web content.

        -> NOTE: All Servers that host websites must have web server program.

    
    -> Below Work Is More Of System Admin Work 

        -> As Web Server Works On HTTP with Port 80, update the Firewall with HTTP 

    -> Commands to work with Web Application Deployment 

    -> Web Server runs on port 80 

    -> Commands to check, which port is in use by which service 

        -> sudo ss -ntpl 

    -> Install Web Server i.e Nginx HTTP Server 

        -> sudo apt update -y 
        -> sudo apt install nginx -y 
        -> sudo ss -ntpl 
    
    -> Test Web Server 

        -> Browse Public IP 

    -> For Web Servers, we have DocumentRoot i.e location 
        where web pages will be loaded from /var/www/html 

        -> ls /var/www/html 

        -> index page is called Landing Page Of Application

        -> cat /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

        -> Repo URL - https://github.com/ravi2krishna/login-2601.git

        -> Clone Repo Using CLI 

            -> sudo git clone <url> <destination_directory>

            -> sudo git clone https://github.com/ravi2krishna/login-2601.git /var/www/html 

                -> fatal: destination path '/var/www/html' already exists and is not an empty directory.

            -> Clean Up DocumentRoot

                -> ls /var/www/html/
                
                -> sudo rm /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

                -> ls /var/www/html/

                -> sudo git clone https://github.com/ravi2krishna/login-2516.git /var/www/html 

                -> ls /var/www/html/

                    -> README.md  img_avatar2.png  index.html (Success)
                
                -> Browse Public IP

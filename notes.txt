    -> What Is DevOps ?

        -> DevOps is a set of "PRACTICES" that works to "AUTOMATE" and "INTEGRATE" 
        the processes between Software Development (Dev) and IT Operations(Ops) teams.

    -> Development Team

        -> To "Build Applications" We need Roles Like 

                -> Software Architect 
                -> System Engineer
                -> Software Developers 
                -> Software Testers 
                -> etc 

    -> Operations Team

        -> To "Build Infrastructure" & Maintain Applications, We need Roles Like 

                -> System Admin 
                -> Network Admin 
                -> Cloud Admin 
                -> Security Admin 
                -> etc 

    -> DevOps Engineer

        -> DevOps Engineers will implement a set of "PRACTICES" using "TOOLS" so that 
        organizations can build, test, and deploy [ DELIVERY LINE ] software 
        faster and more reliably.

    
    -> DevOps PRACTICES     ==>     "TOOLS" 

        -> Version Control Systems (VCS) ==> Git

            -> For Tracking Code 

            -> Happens Inside Developer Laptop - Local To Individual Developer

        -> Source Code Management (SCM) ==> GitHub 

            -> Store Multiple Versions Of Code 

            -> Happens Inside Organization - Central to All Developer

        -> Containerization ==> Docker 

            -> To Get Acceleration (FASTER) 

        -> Orchestration ==> Kubernetes  

            -> To Get Reliability 
            
            -> Helps Run Applications Without Downtime (Run 24 X 7) - Production Environments 

        -> Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI-CD) ==> GitHub Actions 

            -> To Get Automation In Repetitive Tasks   

    -> DevOps Prerequisites 

        -> Application - Project

            -> SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle 

                -> Requirement -> Design -> Code -> "Build" -> Test -> Release -> "Deploy" 

        -> Servers (AWS & AZURE) - Charges (4 INR Per Hour) 

        -> Command Line Interface - CLI (Linux Commands)

    -> As a DevOps Engineer You are responsible for     

        -> Implement Automation

        -> Implement Acceleration (Fastness)

        -> Implement Reliability (Application Should Always Run)

    
    -> When we start building/developing a project 

        -> SDLC 

            -> The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process followed by 
            software development teams to design, develop and test high-quality software. 

            -> The SDLC consists of multiple stages such as 

                -> Requirement -> Design -> Code -> "Build" -> Test -> Release -> "Deploy" 

                -> NOTE: From DevOps Context 

                    -> Code -> "Build" -> Test -> "Deploy" 

                    -> "Build" & "Deploy" Applications On Servers 

        -> Requirement

            -> Build LMS (Learning Management System): Manage Courses 

                -> Three Tier App Architecture

                    -> One thing the most visited websites have in common is that they are dynamic websites.
                    Their development typically involves server-side coding, client-side coding and 
                    database technology.

            -> Most Popular Applications
                
                -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_languages_used_in_most_popular_websites

        -> Code 

            -> Developers will use "Git" to track code and eventually "Push" Code to "GitHub"

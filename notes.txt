    -> What Is DevOps ?

        -> DevOps is a set of "PRACTICES" that works to "AUTOMATE" and "INTEGRATE" 
        the processes between Software Development (Dev) and IT Operations(Ops) teams.

    -> Development Team

        -> To "Build Applications" We need Roles Like 

                -> Software Architect 
                -> System Engineer
                -> Software Developers 
                -> Software Testers 
                -> etc 

    -> Operations Team

        -> To "Build Infrastructure" & Maintain Applications, We need Roles Like 

                -> System Admin 
                -> Network Admin 
                -> Cloud Admin 
                -> Security Admin 
                -> etc 

    -> DevOps Engineer

        -> DevOps Engineers will implement a set of "PRACTICES" using "TOOLS" so that 
        organizations can build, test, and deploy [ DELIVERY LINE ] software 
        faster and more reliably.

    
    -> DevOps PRACTICES     ==>     "TOOLS" 

        -> Version Control Systems (VCS) ==> Git

            -> For Tracking Code 

            -> Happens Inside Developer Laptop - Local To Individual Developer

        -> Source Code Management (SCM) ==> GitHub 

            -> Store Multiple Versions Of Code 

            -> Happens Inside Organization - Central to All Developer

        -> Containerization ==> Docker 

            -> To Get Acceleration (FASTER) 

        -> Orchestration ==> Kubernetes  

            -> To Get Reliability 
            
            -> Helps Run Applications Without Downtime (Run 24 X 7) - Production Environments 

        -> Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI-CD) ==> GitHub Actions 

            -> To Get Automation In Repetitive Tasks   

    -> DevOps Prerequisites 

        -> Application - Project

            -> SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle 

                -> Requirement -> Design -> Code -> "Build" -> Test -> Release -> "Deploy" 

        -> Servers (AWS & AZURE) - Charges (4 INR Per Hour) 

        -> Command Line Interface - CLI (Linux Commands)

    -> As a DevOps Engineer You are responsible for     

        -> Implement Automation

        -> Implement Acceleration (Fastness)

        -> Implement Reliability (Application Should Always Run)

    
    -> When we start building/developing a project 

        -> SDLC 

            -> The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process followed by 
            software development teams to design, develop and test high-quality software. 

            -> The SDLC consists of multiple stages such as 

                -> Requirement -> Design -> Code -> "Build" -> Test -> Release -> "Deploy" 

                -> NOTE: From DevOps Context 

                    -> Code -> "Build" -> Test -> "Deploy" 

                    -> "Build" & "Deploy" Applications On Servers 

        -> Requirement

            -> Build LMS (Learning Management System): Manage Courses 

                -> Three Tier App Architecture

                    -> One thing the most visited websites have in common is that they are dynamic websites.
                    Their development typically involves server-side coding, client-side coding and 
                    database technology.

            -> Most Popular Applications
                
                -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_languages_used_in_most_popular_websites

        -> Code 

            -> Developers will use "Git" to track code and eventually "Push" Code to "GitHub"

============

    -> LMS Project 

    -> "DEVELOPMENT" team

        -> DEVELOPMENT Team mainly builds Applications 

        -> DEVELOPMENT Means Coding 

    -> Version Control Systems (VCS)

        ->  Version control / Revision control / Source control
            is a process that helps to "keep track of changes" made to 
            files (computer programs, web site files, documents etc)

        -> https://www.sirhow.com/uploads/2023/07/check-gpay-transaction-history-step-4.jpg

        -> Advantage Of VCS is Revert Changes To Previous Working Versions, 
            if there are issues in new version

            -> TransactionIDs == Commit IDs 

    -> To Implement Version Control System we need "Git" Software 

        -> Git helps in tracking code / changes in your code 

        -> Git tracks code in your laptop 

        -> Git will generate commit id for every change we make (like every transaction me make in UPI)


    -> All the transactions made will be stored in Server, similarly we store all our
    commit id's in Source Code Management(SCM) like a Server 

        -> NOTE: Mobile Phone -> GooglePay -> Bank Server(TransactionIDs)

        -> NOTE: Laptop -> Git -> GitHub(Commit IDs )

    -> GitHub - Server Side Software  - Organizations

            -> GitHub provides a platform to store code and it's versions 

            -> GitHub Stores All Versions Of Code in centralized location (github.com)    

    -> NOTE: Example of Real World Application

        -> https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ - APP

        -> https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus - CODE

        -> https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/graphs/contributors - HISTORY 

        -> https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commits/master/ - Commits 

    -> Repository 

        -> A repository contains all of your "project's files" and each file's revision history. 
        Developers can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

            -> https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus

            -> https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/tags


    -> JIRA (Proprietary)

        -> Jira is a proprietary product developed by Atlassian that allows 
        bug tracking, issue tracking and agile project management. 

        -> https://images.ctfassets.net/xjcz23wx147q/2vuHCsAF3tUpzYykEb9GAX/11fb10694a339636aceb9f531f11e49f/Kanban-updated.png

    -> GitHub Projects & Issues (FREE)

            -> GitHub Projects are a feature within GitHub designed for planning and tracking work

            -> GitHub Issues is a built-in, lightweight issue-tracking system in every repository 
                used for planning, discussing, and tracking work like 
                bug reports, new features, and tasks.

            -> NOTE: Within Project we have Issues
